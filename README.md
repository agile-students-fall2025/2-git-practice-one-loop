# Git Practice

## Article
[Here's an interesting article](https://medium.com/@dan.avila7/claude-code-from-zero-to-hero-bebe2436ac32) that I found particularly eye-opening. It highlights both the incredible potential and the current limitations of AI tools in software engineering. 

It's almost astonishing — and a little concerning — how effectively AI can **write code, debug, and even build applications from a single prompt**. At the same time, AI is poised to **transform the future of software development**. Learning how to leverage these tools effectively will likely become **essential for future software engineers and development teams**.

@xl4624: This is pretty cool article, I've never used Claude Code but I tried Gemini CLI and I thought it performed decently. In my opinion I'm more bullish on AI tools integrated within the IDE than completely separate Command Line tools. I think for quality code you need a human to verify the code looks correct, and also having the AI integrated into your IDE gives it access to the files you're looking at, any lint/warnings from the LSP, as well as your terminal/build output - all of which make the agent loop run more smoothly.

@haroonshafi: I agree with the point that AI integrated in IDEs is powerful (although to be honest, I still use it separately). I’ve noticed that tools like GitHub Copilot make development faster, but they still require human judgment to ensure correctness.  
Personally, I think the biggest benefit is not in writing entire apps, but in reducing repetitive coding and helping with debugging.
